# Call Activity and Organization Renewal Analysis Using MySQL

Problem Statement
You are working with call data for organizations and need to analyze their interactions based on call history. The analysis involves filtering data by specific criteria such as location, call frequency, and organization status (renewed or not renewed). The following tasks must be performed using SQL queries:

First Connected Call for Renewed Organizations:

Extract the first connected call for all renewed organizations located in Gujarat.
Call Frequency Analysis:

Count the organizations that had three consecutive calls, excluding Saturdays and Sundays, within different time ranges from the organization creation date:
0-4 days
5-8 days
8-15 days
16-30 days
30+ days
Perform this analysis separately for both renewed and not renewed organizations.
Location with Maximum Unique Connected Calls:

Identify the location with the maximum number of connected calls for unique leads.
Reasons for Unconnected Calls:

For calls that were not connected, identify the most common reason(s) for the failure to connect.
Summary:

Summarize your analysis findings based on the above queries.
